    <span class="aboutSectionsTitle">Why Lend?</span>

    <p class="text">
     Lending ordinary items to members of your commnuity did not use to be possible before Lendit.  Now it is as simple,
      as taking a picture and waiting for someone who needs your item. But why should you lend?  Many reasons, each as
      unique as the items you want to lend.  But some reasons are you would like to make extra money or made them spend money on something they really only needed to use once.
      Through {{$ctrl.APP_NAME}} you can now monetize on the items you already own and make it possible for others to
      to use your item and not have to shell out the cash to buy it for one time use. You are looking for another avenue of passive
      income and what can be more passive than giving an item to someone and picking it back up after a certain amount of time.
      You may not want to lend every item you own, but many people find that they have items lying around the house that
      they have only ever used once, whether its an expensive tool, a surfboard, or a fire pit.
